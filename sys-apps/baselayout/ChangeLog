*baselayout-1.12.13-r1 (11 Sep 2010)

  11 Sep 2010; Amadeusz Żołnowski <aidecoe@aidecoe.name>
  +baselayout-1.12.13-r1.ebuild,
  +files/baselayout-1.12.13-proc_sysfs_devpts.patch:
  In short: this updated enables Dracut to run on baselayout-1.

  Ebuild is copied from original Portage tree.  I've removed obsolete SRC_URI's
  and applied my patch.  With the patch 'rc' script checks first if /proc, /sys
  and devpts are already mounted and skips mount if they're are.  Before mount
  script checks if directories are clean.

  For details see bug #291916, #336723 and #336726.
